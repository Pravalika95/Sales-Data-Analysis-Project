PRAVALIKA PROJECT ON SALES ANALYSIS

Agenda

Data Analysis
Identifying key metrics
New schema
Data Ingestion
SQL
Plots or dashboards

==========================================================

Data analysis

-> Per document, Have gone through all the 3 datasets provided
-> Tried to see the relation between each dataset
-> Analyzed key components from these 3 datasets to come up with impact full insights from available data
-> Analyzed data transformations need to be done from available data

==========================================================

Key metrics

- ACV Bookings: Measure of actualized annual contract value (closed won deals).
- Win Rate: Ratio of closed won opportunities to total opportunities.
- Pipeline Generated: Total value of opportunities created.
- Quota Attainment by Sales Rep: ACV Bookings in a quarter divided by the assigned quota for the quarter.

===========================================================

New schema

- Create tables for Opportunity, Quota, and Fiscal_Calendar.
- Normalize data to avoid redundancy and ensure extensibility.
- Utilize views for aggregated metrics to enhance performance.
- Consider incremental updates for efficient data processing.

==========================================================

Data ingestion

- Use Python to ingest CSV data into the database.
- Utilize libraries like pandas to manipulate data efficiently.

==========================================================

SQL Queries & PLOTS

- Write SQL queries to generate desired outputs from source tables.
- Include joins, aggregations, and filters as necessary.
- Adding plots using python
- Creating dashboards using visualization tools
